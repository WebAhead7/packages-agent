<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->

## About The Project

Package_agent is one of the two versions of the project, dedicated to shipping agents.
Everyone can join it, and become a shipper; all you need is to register to our app and then can immediately start working with us.
If any parcel or package is found around your current location and its planned destination close to yours, then you could make extra money by picking up it and delivering it to its buyer (client).
